# SalesforceInspector
Chrome Extension Salesforce Inspector core with modifications to support .mil domains.
This is based off my fork of the SalesforceInspector Chrome Extension.  This repo contains the plugin core that you would load into Chrome.

Until my PR is accepted, this is the only way to get SalesforceInspector to work on .mil domains.
